Assisted Practice: 3.7 File Handling Mechanisms
This section will guide you to: 
●	Write a program in Java to demonstrate exception handling
●	Use Eclipse (the popular text editor for Java programs) 
●	Push code to Git

This lab has six sub-sections, namely:
3.7.1	Creating a new project in Eclipse
3.7.2	Writing a program in Java to create a file
3.7.3	Writing a program in Java to read a file
3.7.4	Writing a program in Java to update a file
3.7.5	Writing a program in Java to delete a file
3.7.6	Pushing the code to your GitHub repositories

Step 3.7.1: Creating a new project in Eclipse
●	Open Eclipse
●	Go to File -> New -> Project -> Java Project -> Next.
●	Type in any project name and click on “Finish.”
●	Select your project and go to File -> New -> Class.
●	Enter CreateNewFile in any class name, check the checkbox “public static void main(String[] args)”., and click on “Finish.”

Step 3.7.2: Writing a program in Java to create a file
